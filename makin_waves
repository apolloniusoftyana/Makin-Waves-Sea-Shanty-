Verse 1: 
When I was a young boy, no older than eight
My mother told me, everythin’ will be alright
As long as I’m a good boy and stop makin’ waves
And be like my sister, who never misbehaves 

Chorus:
If you want to go make waves, you best go out to sea
You won’t be makin’ friends here, causin’ trouble is all you be
Go live your life elsewhere, make a ship your only home
Out there on the ocean, forever you will roam 

Verse 2:
When I was a young man, just barely a teen 
My father told me, while not trying to be mean
Better go and find work, it’s time to start your own life
You can’t stay here much longer, you’re nothin’ here but strife

Chorus:
If you want to go make waves, you best go out to sea
You won’t be makin’ friends here, causin’ trouble is all you be
Go live your life elsewhere, make a ship your only home
Out there on the ocean, forever you will roam 

Verse 3:
Out upon the ocean, searching for fortune and fame
I came across a young lass, Jeni was her name
A small raven haired woman, who was cunning and brave
She would show me no interest, I’m just a foolish knave

Chorus:
If you want to go make waves, you best go out to sea
You won’t be makin’ friends here, causin’ trouble is all you be
Go live your life elsewhere, make a ship your only home
Out there on the ocean, forever you will roam 

Verse 4:
Now as an old man, retired from my ship
Jeni tells me, she’ll be here when I replace my hip
I’ve seen too many battles, got trouble in my blood
Jeni knows it all, she pulled me from the mud

Chorus:
If you want to go make waves, you best go out to sea
You won’t be makin’ friends here, causin’ trouble is all you be
Go live your life elsewhere, make a ship your only home
Out there on the ocean, forever you will roam 

Chorus:
If you want to go make waves, you best go out to sea
You won’t be makin’ friends here, causin’ trouble is all you be
Go live your life elsewhere, make a ship your only home
Out there on the ocean, forever you will roam
